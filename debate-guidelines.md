# Debate Guidelines

## Purpose
This debate is designed to explore ethical reasoning through the lens of two major moral frameworks: **Utilitarianism** and **Deontology**. The goal is not to win an argument, but to deepen understanding of each framework's strengths, weaknesses, and logical implications.

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Respectful Dialogue**
   - All comments, reviews, and arguments must be phrased respectfully.
   - Critique ideas, not people. Avoid personal attacks, sarcasm, or derogatory language.
   - Assume good faith: everyone is participating to learn, not to “win.”

2. **Logical Argumentation**
   - Base arguments on the principles of the assigned ethical framework.
   - Clearly state your premises and conclusions.
   - Use evidence or reasoning consistent with the framework.

3. **Citation of Ethical Principles**
   - When making a claim, reference the specific ethical principle you are applying.
   - For utilitarians: refer to concepts like “maximizing utility,” “greatest good for the greatest number.”
   - For deontologists: refer to concepts like “moral duty,” “categorical imperative.”

4. **Focus on the Thought Experiment**
   - Stay within the bounds of the classic trolley problem as described in the README.

5. **Collaborative Review**
   - When reviewing the opposing team’s pull request, focus on **specific lines or paragraphs**.
   - Use GitHub’s inline comments to ask clarifying questions, point out inconsistencies, or challenge assumptions.

6. **Synthesis and Reflection**
   - After the debate, each participant must write a personal synthesis that acknowledges the strongest point from the opposing side and identifies the biggest weakness in their own team’s argument.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Read the scenario** (README.md) and these guidelines.
2. **Choose a team** based on the issue you are assigned (Proposition A = Utilitarian, Proposition B = Deontological).
3. **Create a branch** for your team’s argument (`utilitarian-argument` or `deontological-argument`).
4. **Write your argument** in the appropriate file (`argument-for-pulling.md` or `argument-against-pulling.md`).
5. **Open a pull request** with a descriptive title and a brief summary of your argument.
6. **Review the opposing team’s pull request** by leaving inline comments.
7. **Respond to comments** on your own pull request, clarifying or refining your argument as needed.
8. **After the teacher merges both PRs**, create a `personal-synthesis.md` file in the main branch, following the instructions in the “Synthesis and Reflection” issue.

## Expectations for Arguments

- **Utilitarian Argument**: Should explicitly calculate (or reason about) the net utility of pulling vs. not pulling the lever. Address potential objections.
- **Deontological Argument**: Should articulate a moral rule or duty that prohibits pulling the lever. Explain why the action itself is wrong regardless of the outcome.

## Teacher’s Role
The teacher will:
- Monitor all discussions to ensure respectful and productive dialogue.
- Add clarifying comments or questions to guide the debate.
- Correct any major misunderstandings of the ethical frameworks.
- Merge the pull requests after the review period.
- Create the final “Synthesis and Reflection” issue.

## Code of Conduct
By participating, you agree to uphold these guidelines. Violations may result in removal from the activity.
