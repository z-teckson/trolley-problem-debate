# Utilitarian Argument: Pull the Lever

## Ethical Framework
Utilitarianism, as articulated by philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, holds that the moral worth of an action is determined solely by its contribution to overall utility—that is, the sum of pleasure or happiness minus suffering. The principle of **maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number** guides ethical decision‑making.

## Application to the Trolley Problem

### 1. The Utility Calculus
If we assign each human life an equal positive value (representing the future happiness, relationships, and contributions that life would produce), then:

- **Option A (Do nothing):** Five lives are lost → net utility = –5.
- **Option B (Pull the lever):** One life is lost, five are saved → net utility = +4 (five saved minus one killed).

Even if we discount the value of each life by any conceivable factor (age, health, social role), the ratio remains 5:1. Therefore, pulling the lever yields a net gain of four lives, which corresponds to a net increase in overall happiness and a net decrease in overall suffering.

### 2. The Consequentialist Perspective
Utilitarianism is a **consequentialist** theory; it judges actions by their outcomes, not by the intentions or the nature of the act itself. In this scenario, the outcome of pulling the lever is objectively better: five people continue to live, one person dies. The outcome of inaction is objectively worse: five people die, one person lives. Since the morally right action is the one that produces the best consequences, pulling the lever is obligatory.

### 3. Addressing Common Objections

#### Objection 1: “You become an active killer.”
From a utilitarian standpoint, the distinction between “killing” and “letting die” is morally irrelevant if the consequences are identical. In both cases, a person dies because of the agent’s choice. The only relevant difference is the number of deaths. Choosing not to act is still a choice, and its consequence (five deaths) is worse than the consequence of acting (one death). Therefore, the “active/passive” distinction does not change the utility calculation.

#### Objection 2: “You cannot treat human lives as mere numbers.”
Utilitarians do not treat lives as “mere numbers”; they acknowledge the intrinsic value of each individual’s happiness. However, when forced to choose between two tragic outcomes, we must compare the aggregate happiness that each option would preserve. Saving five lives preserves five times as much potential happiness, relationships, and future contributions as saving one life. Ignoring the quantitative difference would mean arbitrarily privileging one life over five—a decision that itself lacks a moral foundation.

#### Objection 3: “The slippery slope—what if we start sacrificing individuals for any ‘greater good’?”
The trolley problem is a controlled thought experiment designed to isolate a specific moral principle. In real‑world policy, utilitarians advocate for rules and institutions that generally protect individual rights, because such rules tend to maximize long‑term utility. The hypothetical extremity of the trolley problem does not justify abandoning utilitarian reasoning; rather, it clarifies that when all other factors are equal, minimizing total harm is the rational moral choice.

### 4. The Principle of Impartiality
Utilitarianism demands **impartiality**: the agent’s own relationship to the victims (or the bystander) must not influence the decision. Whether the five workers are strangers or family members, the moral calculus remains the same. This impartiality ensures that the decision is based on objective welfare rather than personal bias.

## Conclusion
According to utilitarian ethics, the only morally defensible course of action is to pull the lever. Doing so saves five lives at the cost of one, thereby maximizing overall happiness and minimizing overall suffering. Any alternative would knowingly allow a greater amount of harm to occur, which is incompatible with the fundamental goal of utilitarianism: to produce the greatest good for the greatest number.
