# Deontological Argument: Do Not Pull the Lever

## Ethical Framework
Deontology, most famously associated with Immanuel Kant, holds that the morality of an action depends on its adherence to a moral rule or duty, not on its consequences. According to deontological ethics, certain actions are intrinsically wrong—such as killing an innocent person—regardless of the good that might result from them. The **categorical imperative** requires us to act only on maxims that we could will to become universal laws, and to treat humanity never merely as a means to an end, but always as an end in itself.

## Application to the Trolley Problem

### 1. The Duty Not to Kill
Pulling the lever constitutes an intentional act of killing. The one worker on the side track is an innocent person who is not directly threatening anyone. Deontological ethics posits a strong duty not to kill innocent persons. This duty is not overridden by the prospect of saving a greater number of lives, because the moral wrongness of killing is independent of consequences.

If we were to universalize the maxim “I may kill one innocent person to save five others,” we would create a world in which anyone could be sacrificed whenever a calculator deems it “net beneficial.” Such a world would undermine the fundamental respect for human dignity and the right to life that deontology seeks to protect.

### 2. The Distinction Between Killing and Letting Die
Deontologists often emphasize the moral difference between **killing** (an active intervention that causes death) and **letting die** (a passive failure to prevent death). In the trolley scenario, pulling the lever is an act of killing; not pulling the lever is a case of letting die. While letting five die may be tragic, it does not involve the agent in the same direct, causal responsibility for those deaths as does deliberately diverting the trolley to kill one.

This distinction matters because our moral duties are primarily negative: we have a stronger obligation to refrain from doing harm than to provide aid. The duty not to kill is more stringent than the duty to save lives, especially when saving lives requires violating the former duty.

### 3. The Principle of Double Effect
Some deontologists invoke the **doctrine of double effect**, which permits an action that has both good and bad effects only if:
- The action itself is morally good or neutral.
- The bad effect is not intended but merely foreseen.
- The good effect is not produced by means of the bad effect.
- The good effect outweighs the bad effect proportionally.

In pulling the lever, the death of the one worker is not a side‑effect; it is the very means by which the five are saved (the trolley must hit that worker to be diverted). Therefore, the bad effect is intended as a means, violating the third condition. Consequently, the action is morally impermissible even under double‑effect reasoning.

### 4. Treating Persons as Ends, Not Means
Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative demands that we treat humanity always as an end in itself, never merely as a means. By pulling the lever, we use the lone worker as a mere instrument—a sacrificial pawn—to achieve the goal of saving the five. We reduce his life to a resource for maximizing overall utility, thereby disrespecting his inherent dignity and autonomy.

The five workers, though they would benefit, are also treated merely as numbers in a utilitarian calculation. Deontology rejects such instrumentalization of human beings, insisting that each person possesses unconditional worth that cannot be traded off.

### 5. Addressing Common Objections

#### Objection 1: “Isn’t it irrational to let five die when you could save them by sacrificing one?”
Deontology does not deny the tragic nature of the choice. However, rationality in ethics is not reducible to outcome‑maximization. Moral rationality requires acting on principles that respect the equal worth of every person. Sacrificing one person for the sake of others violates that equality by treating the sacrificed individual as less valuable.

#### Objection 2: “What if the five are your family members? Wouldn’t you pull the lever then?”
Deontological duties are universal and impartial. Personal relationships may create additional special obligations, but they do not cancel the fundamental duty not to kill an innocent person. Even to save loved ones, a deontologist would maintain that murder remains morally prohibited. The thought experiment asks us to abstract from personal ties precisely to focus on the underlying principle.

#### Objection 3: “Inaction is still a choice; you are responsible for the five deaths.”
Responsibility for an outcome is not the same as moral culpability for an action. One can be causally responsible for a death by omission, but the moral wrongness of an omission depends on the nature of the duty violated. Here, the duty not to kill is stronger than the duty to rescue; therefore, violating the former is morally worse than failing to fulfill the latter.

## Conclusion
From a deontological perspective, pulling the lever is morally wrong because it involves the intentional killing of an innocent person, uses that person merely as a means to an end, and cannot be universalized without undermining the very foundation of moral respect. The morally required action is to refrain from pulling the lever, even though that results in the death of five individuals. Deontology prioritizes the integrity of moral principles over the optimization of outcomes, affirming that certain actions are never permissible, regardless of the consequences.
