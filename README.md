# Trolley Problem Debate

## The Scenario

A runaway trolley is barreling down the tracks toward five workers who are unaware of its approach. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track. However, there is one worker on that side track who will be killed if you pull the lever. Your choices are:

1. **Do nothing**, allowing five people to die.
2. **Pull the lever**, actively causing the death of one person to save five.

## Purpose

This repository hosts a structured, collaborative debate on this classic ethical thought experiment. The goal is not to "solve" the problem, but to use the GitHub workflow to structure a formal debate between two opposing ethical positions: **Utilitarianism** and **Deontology**.

Students will explore these moral frameworks, write arguments, review each other's work, and reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## How to Participate

1. Read the [debate guidelines](debate-guidelines.md).
2. Join either the **Utilitarian** or **Deontological** team.
3. Follow the instructions in the respective issue ([Proposition A](https://github.com/z-teckson/trolley-problem-debate/issues/1) or [Proposition B](https://github.com/z-teckson/trolley-problem-debate/issues/2)).
4. Create a branch, write your team's argument, and open a pull request.
5. Review the opposing team's pull request.
6. After the debate, write a personal synthesis.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` – This file, describing the scenario and instructions.
- `debate-guidelines.md` – Rules of engagement for the debate.
- `argument-for-pulling.md` – The utilitarian argument (to be added via pull request).
- `argument-against-pulling.md` – The deontological argument (to be added via pull request).
- `personal-synthesis.md` – Individual reflections (to be added after the debate).

## Ethical Frameworks

- **Utilitarianism**: An ethical theory that determines right from wrong by focusing on outcomes. The most ethical choice is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.
- **Deontology**: An ethical theory that stresses the importance of following moral rules or duties, regardless of the consequences. Actions are judged as right or wrong based on whether they adhere to a moral principle.
